"""
Problem:
There is a 4cm bar at room temperature of 25째C. 
One of its ends is subjected to a 120째c temperature,
and the other end to a 50째c temperature. 
Calculate temperature distribution for each 0.4 cm after 5 seconds,
for the following material: steel, pottery and copper.

The given alpha coefficients are:
0.167cm^3 / seg
0.1515cm^3 / seg
0.1350cm^3 / seg

According to the obtained results, indicate which material 
corresponds to each given alpha value and say why.

Solution approach:
Utilize the explicit method according to the convergence standard.
