"""
-Problem:
There's a metallic bar (alpha = 0.18cm) of about 120 centimetres long,
with an initial temperature distribution given by:
	U(x, 0) = 10x^2 Where U is expressed as Â°C and X as cm.

It's also known that:
	U(0, t) = 6(15 - t)
	U(L, t) = 2t - 3

Determine the temperature distribution after 60 seconds.

-Solution approach:
Crank-Nicholson method, according to the convergence standard.
